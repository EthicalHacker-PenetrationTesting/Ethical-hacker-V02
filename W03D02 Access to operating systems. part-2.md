First things we want to run Kali and Window 10,  we will use **Veil - Framework** by using this steps:

1. Go to the terminal and write, `rm -rf /root/.config/wine/vei` 
2. In the terminal write cd `cd /usr/share/vril/config`
3. Then write `./setup.py --force --silent`
4. Finally, `cd ..` and write `./veil.py`
