1. What Burp Suite.
2. Overview of the available tools in Burp Suite.
3. Installing Burp Suite.
4. Navigating and configuring Burp Suite.

## What Burp Suite

Burp Suite is a framework written in Java that aims to provide a one-stop-shop for web application penetration testing and Its various tools work seamlessly together to support the entire testing process, from initial mapping and analysis of an applicationâ€™s attack surface, through to finding and exploiting security vulnerabilities.

In its simplest form, **Burp Suite** can be classified as an Interception Proxy. While browsing their target application, a penetration tester can configure their internet browser to route traffic through the **Burp Suite** proxy server.

## Overview of the available tools in Burp Suite

Whilst Burp Community has a relatively limited feature-set compared to the Professional edition, it still has many superb tools available. These include:

| Features  | Used for                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Proxy     | The Burp Proxy allows us to intercept and modify requests/responses when interacting with web applications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Repeater  | allows us to capture, modify, then resend the same request numerous times. This feature can be absolutely invaluable, especially when we need to craft a payload through trial and error (e.g. in an SQL i -- **S**tructured **Q**uery **L**anguage **I**njection) or when testing the functionality of an endpoint for flaws. |
| Intruder  | allows us to spray an endpoint with requests. This is often used for brute force attacks or to fuzz endpoints.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Decoder   | Decoder still provides a valuable service when transforming data either in terms of decoding captured information, or encoding a payload prior to sending it to the target                                                                                                                                                     |
| Compare   | allows us to compare two pieces of data at either word or byte level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Sequencer | We usually use Sequencer when assessing the randomness of tokens such as session cookie values or other supposedly random generated data                                                                                                                                                                                       |
