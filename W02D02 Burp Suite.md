## What Burp Suite

Burp Suite is a framework written in Java that aims to provide a one-stop-shop for web application penetration testing and Its various tools work seamlessly together to support the entire testing process, from initial mapping and analysis of an applicationâ€™s attack surface, through to finding and exploiting security vulnerabilities.

In its simplest form, **Burp Suite** can be classified as an Interception Proxy. While browsing their target application, a penetration tester can configure their internet browser to route traffic through the **Burp Suite** proxy server.
