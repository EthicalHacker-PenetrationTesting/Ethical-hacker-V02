## High Level Goals

By the end of this lesson, you will be familiar with the following:

1. What Burp Suite.
2. Overview of the available tools in Burp Suite.
3. Navigating and configuring Burp Suite.

## What Burp Suite

Burp Suite is a framework written in Java that aims to provide a one-stop-shop for web application penetration testing and Its various tools work seamlessly together to support the entire testing process, from initial mapping and analysis of an applicationâ€™s attack surface, through to finding and exploiting security vulnerabilities.

In its simplest form, **Burp Suite** can be classified as an Interception Proxy. While browsing their target application, a penetration tester can configure their internet browser to route traffic through the **Burp Suite** proxy server.

## Overview of the available tools in Burp Suite

Whilst Burp Community has a relatively limited feature-set compared to the Professional edition, it still has many superb tools available. These include:

| Features  | Used for                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Proxy     | The Burp Proxy allows us to intercept and modify requests/responses when interacting with web applications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Repeater  | allows us to capture, modify, then resend the same request numerous times. This feature can be absolutely invaluable, especially when we need to craft a payload through trial and error (e.g. in an SQL i -- **S**tructured **Q**uery **L**anguage **I**njection) or when testing the functionality of an endpoint for flaws. |
| Intruder  | allows us to spray an endpoint with requests. This is often used for brute force attacks or to fuzz endpoints.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Decoder   | Decoder still provides a valuable service when transforming data either in terms of decoding captured information, or encoding a payload prior to sending it to the target                                                                                                                                                     |
| Compare   | allows us to compare two pieces of data at either word or byte level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Sequencer | We usually use Sequencer when assessing the randomness of tokens such as session cookie values or other supposedly random generated data                                                                                                                                                                                       |

## Navigating and configuring Burp Suite

- let's start the Burp Suite open terminal and typing this command

      burpsuite

**If** you get these issue

![burp1](/img/burp1.png)

click in `OK`.

Navigating around the Burp Suite GUI by default is done entirely using the top menu bars:

![b-1](/img/b-1.png)

In addition to the menu bar, Burp Suite also has keyboard shortcuts that allow quick navigation to key tabs. By default, these are:

| **Shortcut**       | **Does**                   |
| ------------------ | -------------------------- |
| `Ctrl + Shift + D` | Switch to the Dashboard    |
| `Ctrl + Shift + T` | Switch to the Target tab   |
| `Ctrl + Shift + P` | Switch to the Proxy tab    |
| `Ctrl + Shift + I` | Switch to the Intruder tab |
| `Ctrl + Shift + R` | Switch to the Repeater tab |

### User options tab

The options provided in the User options tab will apply every time we open Burp Suite. In contrast, the Project options will only apply to the _current_ project. Given that we can't save projects in Burp Community, this means that our project options will reset every time we close Burp.

![b-2 here](/img/b-2.png)

> The settings here apply globally (i.e. they control the Burp Suite application -- not just the project). That said, many of them can be overwritten in the project settings.

There are four main subsections of the User options tab:

- The options in the **Connections** sub-tab allow us to control how Burp makes connections to targets. For example, we can set a proxy for Burp Suite to connect through; this is very useful if we want to use Burp Suite through a network pivot.

- The **TLS** sub-tab allows us to enable and disable various TLS (**T**ransport **L**ayer **S**ecurity) options, as well as giving us a place to upload client certificates should a web app require us to use one for connections.

- An essential set of options: **Display** allows us to change how Burp Suite looks. The options here include things like changing the font and scale, as well as setting the theme for the framework (e.g. dark mode) and configuring various options to do with the rendering engine in Repeater (we will toke about this later).

- The Misc sub-tab contains a wide variety of settings, including the keybinding table (Hotkeys), which allowing us to view and alter the keyboard shortcuts used by Burp Suite. Familiarizing yourself with these settings would be advisable, as using the key binds can speed up your workflow massively
