## Introduction 

In this stage, we're going to be talking about gaining access to computer devices.

What do we mean by computer devices?
Any electronic device you see is a computer. A phone, a TV, a laptop, a web server, a website, a network, a router, all of these things are computers
Each one of them has an operating system, and they have programs installed on these operating systems.
