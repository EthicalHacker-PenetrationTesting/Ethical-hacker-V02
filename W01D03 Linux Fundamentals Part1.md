# Linux Fundamentals

## High Level Goals

In this lesson, we're going to learn some more commands for interacting with the filesystem to allow us to:

-  Advancing your knowledge of the filesystem
-  introducing you to the access mechanisms
-  Common Directories

## Advancing your knowledge of the filesystem

In this section, we're going to learn some more commands for interacting with the filesystem to allow us to:

-   create files and folders
-   move files and folders
-   delete files and folders

More specifically, the following commands:

| Command | Full Name | Purpose |
|--|--|--|
| touch | touch | Create file |
| mkdir | make directory | Create a folder |
| cp | copy | Copy a file or folder |
| mv | move | Move a file or folder |
| rm | remove | Remove a file or folder |
| file | file | Determine the type of file |

> _Protip: Similarly to using cat, we can provide full file paths, i.e. directory1/directory2/note for all of these commands_
