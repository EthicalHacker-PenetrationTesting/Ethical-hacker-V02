## Google Dorks

A Google dork query, sometimes just referred to as a dork, is a search string that uses advanced search operators to find information that is not readily available on a website.

A search parameter is a limitation applied to a search. Here are a few examples of advanced search parameters:

| parameter    | usage                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **site**     | returns files located on a particular website or domain.                                                                                                                                                      |
| **filetype** | followed (without a space) by a file extension returns files of the specified type, such as DOC, PDF, XLS and INI. Multiple file types can be searched for simultaneously by separating extensions with “\|”. |
| **inurl**    | followed by a particular string returns results with that sequence of characters in the URL.                                                                                                                  |
| **intext**   | followed by the searcher’s chosen word or phrase returns files with the string anywhere in the text.                                                                                                          |
