# Introduction Ethical-hacker

## High Level Goals

By the end of this Stage, you will be familiar with the following:

- What is the Ethical-hacker
- Build up your Lap
- Linux Fundamentals
- Information gathering
- Network Exploitation
- Windows Exploitation
- Cryptography
- Web Hacking

## What is the Ethical-hacker
Ethical hacking involves an authorized attempt to gain unauthorized access to a computer system, application, or data. Carrying out an ethical hack involves duplicating strategies and actions of malicious attackers. This practice helps to identify security vulnerabilities, which can then be resolved before a malicious attacker has the opportunity to exploit them.


## Build up your Lap

**What is Virtual Lap**

A virtual Lab is a simulated lab environment typically implemented as a software program which allows the users to perform their experiments.

**What we will learn**

We will learn how to download and use this following:

1. Virtual Box.
2. Kali Linux.
3. OWASP.
4. Windows hosting

## Linux Fundamentals

Many servers and security tools use Linux. Learn how to use the Linux operating system, a critical skill in cybersecurity.

Linux is one of the major operating systems and is heavily used in organizations all around the world. Learning how to use Linux is a core competency and will help you in your hacking journey not to just use Linux-based security tools, but how to use and exploit the operating system. This module will focus on getting you comfortable using Linux.

## Information gathering

Information Gathering is the act of gathering different kinds of information against the targeted victim or system. It is the first step or the beginning stage of Ethical Hacking

## Web Hacking

1. How website work 
2. Web Fundamentals
3. Burp suite
4. OWASP
5. Upload vulnerabilities

## Network Exploitation
Networking describes how computers interact and communicate with each other. Since computers can be used for a wide variety of purposes, the way they communicate is varied. This module will introduce the core concepts of computer networking, followed by the methodology and tooling required to attack various network services.

In this stage, we will cover:
1. Pre Connection Attacks
2. Gaining Access
3. post connection attacks

## Cryptography

The internet is used by virtually everyone today for very trivial purposes such as playing games to more important tasks such as online banking. Users have started using the internet to access and utilize important services. A large part of ensuring that this communication is secure is done using Cryptographic primitives. This module will explore core cryptographic topics that are used to secure communication over the internet and in machines/servers.

## Windows Exploitation
Windows is the most popular operating system, used by both individuals and within corporate environments. Windows systems are often linked together to create networks, which are used in most enterprises around the world. This module will explore everything from getting started with using Windows, to attacking common flaws that are found in common Windows systems.
